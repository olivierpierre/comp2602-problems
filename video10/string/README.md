# Video 10 Problem 1

Write a C program reading a string from the standard input using `fgets`, and
diplaying this string as follows:

```shell
./string
input a string:
test
you entered: test

./string
input a string:
hello world!
you entered: hello world!
```

To check the correctness of your program, use CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `string.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/master/video10/string
```
