This is a fake exercise asking you to create an empty C program. To succeed in
this exercise, simply write the following program:

```c
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

To check the correctness of your program, use a
[Linux distribution with check50 installed](https://github.com/olivierpierre/comp26020-devcontainer)
and write your solution in a file named `sample-exercise.c`. In a
terminal, with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/2023-2024/week1-intro/01-sample-exercise
```
