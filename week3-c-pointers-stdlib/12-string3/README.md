Write a C program reading a string from the standard input and capitalize the
first letter of each word.

```shell
./string3
input a string:
we swears, to serve the master of the precious
We Swears, To Serve The Master Of The Precious

./string3
input a string:
and following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been
And Following Our Will And Wind We May Just Go Where No One's Been
```

!!! note "Capitalizing letters"
    See the `toupper` function:

To check the correctness of your program, use CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `string3.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/master/week3-c-pointers-stdlib/12-string3
```
