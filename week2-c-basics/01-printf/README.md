This is a variation of the "hello world" example program presented in the
lecture. Write a C program displaying "Goodbye, world!". The expected output
is:

```shell
Goodbye, world!
```

To check the correctness of your program, use the department VM image with check50 installed or alternatively CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `goodbye.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/2021-2022/week2-c-basics/01-printf
```
