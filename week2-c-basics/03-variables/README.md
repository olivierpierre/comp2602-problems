Write a simple program declaring two variables: `int_var` with type `int` and `double_var` with type `double`. Assign a value to each of them and print their values.
The expected output is as follows:

```
int_var: 42
double_var: 24.000000
```

To check the correctness of your program, use a use a [Linux distribution](https://github.com/olivierpierre/comp26020-devcontainer) with [check50 installed](exercise-set-1.html#installing-check50) and write your solution in a file named **`variables.c`**.
In a terminal, with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/2024-2025/week2-c-basics/03-variables
```
