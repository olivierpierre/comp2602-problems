Write a C program displaying a large 11x9 characters 'C' using dashes.
The expected output is:

```c
    ######
  ##      ##
 #
 #
 #
 #
 #
  ##      ##
    ######
```

To check the correctness of your program, use a
[Linux distribution with check50 installed](https://github.com/olivierpierre/comp26020-devcontainer)
and write your solution in a file named `printf.c`. In a
terminal, with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/2022-2023/week2-c-basics/01-printf
```
