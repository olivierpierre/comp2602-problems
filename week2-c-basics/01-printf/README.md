Write a C program displaying a large 11x9 characters 'C' using dashes.
The expected output is:

```c
    ######
  ##      ##
 #
 #
 #
 #
 #
  ##      ##
    ######
```

To check the correctness of your program, use the department VM image with check50 installed or alternatively CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `printf.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/2022-2023/week2-c-basics/01-printf
```
