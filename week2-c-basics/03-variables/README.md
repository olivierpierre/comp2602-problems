Write a simple program declaring two variables: `int_var` with type `int` and
`double_var` with type `double`. Assign a value to each of them and print their
values. The expected output is as follows:

```
int_var: 42
double_var: 24.000000
```

To check the correctness of your program, use a Linux distribution with
check50 installed or alternatively CS50 [sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/) or
[IDE](https://code.cs50.io/) and write it in a file named `variables.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/2022-2023/week2-c-basics/03-variables
```
