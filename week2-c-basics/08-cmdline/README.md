# Video 5 Problem 2

Write a C program that takes 3 floating point numbers as command line
parameters and displays on the standard boutput the value of the multiplication
of these 3 numbers. Examples of execution:

```shell
./cmdline 1.0 2.0 3.0
6.000000

./cmdline 1.45 2.78 3.25
13.100750
```

To check the correctness of your program, use CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `cmdline.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/master/week2-c-basics/08-cmdline
```
