# Lecture 4 Problem 1

Write a simple program declaring two variables: `int_var` with type `int` and
`double_var` with type `double`. Assign a value to each of them and print their
values. The expected output is as follows:

```
int_var: 42
double_var: 24.000000
```

To check the correctness of your program, use CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `goodbye.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/master/lecture04/variables
```
