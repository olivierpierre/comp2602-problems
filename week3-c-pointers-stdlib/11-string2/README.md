# Video 10 Problem 2

Write a C program reading two strings from the standard input using `fgets`,
and indicating if the strings are similar or not. Output examples:

```shell
./string2
input string1:
test
input string2:
test
strings are similar

./string2
input string1:
hello world!
input string2:
goodbye
strings are different
```

To check the correctness of your program, use CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `string2.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/master/week3-c-pointers-stdlib/11-string2
```
