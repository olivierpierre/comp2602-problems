Write a C program using `malloc` to allocate an array able to contain 10 `int`,
fill this array with the 10 first natural number (starting with 0). Expected
output:

```shell
./malloc
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

To check the correctness of your program, use the department VM image with check50 installed or alternatively CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `malloc.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/master/week3-c-pointers-stdlib/05-malloc
```
