# Lecture 7 Problem 3

Write a C program defining an `enum` with one named value per month of the
year, i.e. `JANUARY`, `FEBRUARY`, `MARCH`, etc. The program prints the numberic
value associated with each month. Example of output:

```
./enum
JANUARY: 0
FEBRUARY: 1
MARCH: 2
APRIL: 3
MAY: 4
JUNE: 5
JULY: 6
AUGUST: 7
SEPTEMBER: 8
OCTOBER: 9
NOVEMBER: 10
DECEMBER: 11
```

To check the correctness of your program, use CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `enum.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/master/lecture07/enum
```
