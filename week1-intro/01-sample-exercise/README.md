# Lecture 0 Problem 1

This is a fake exercise asking you to create an empty C program. To succeed in
this exercise, simply write the following program:

```c
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

To check the correctness of your program, use CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `sample-exercise.c`. In a terminal,
with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```shell
check50 -l --log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/master/week1-intro/01-sample-exercise
```
